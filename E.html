<p>My brother name is Shaksham Saxsena.Sibling relationships play a significant role in how children form friendships in their peer group and bond with other children. Whether younger or older, a brother is every child’s best friend. An older brother is the person who cares for the younger sibling, apart from the parents in the family. Many children think their brothers are a blessing and are lucky to have them. ‘My Brother’ is a common topic for essays assigned as classwork or for an exam. Younger kids may be full of emotions when thinking about their brother, but find it challenging to put their feelings on paper. Here we present a few sample essays for children of classes 1, 2 and 3 to make it easier for them.</p>
